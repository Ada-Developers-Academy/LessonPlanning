# Git

## Overview
Learning Git is almost as important as learning how to write code. 

Git is a 'distributed version control system', which helps you track files and changes to code. Version control, in general, is a system to record changes to a set of files and forms a history of all of the changes.

Each set of tracked files is called a repository ('repo' for short). Because Git is _distributed_, it allows us to work from repos on remote servers, which is essential for team collaboration on projects. 

## Lesson: Git Immersion
Git Immersion is an online tutorial that walks through many important steps toward learning Git. We'll work through labs 01 through 21 in class today. 

Hopefully you've already installed Git in your machine. You can check to make sure it's installed by typing `which git` into your terminal.

After completing labs 01 to 21 on Git Immersion, you will be able to:  

* Set up global configs
* Initialize a Git repo
* Add and commit files to Git
* Check the status of your repository
* Learn 'staging' versus 'committing'
* View your history
* Set up aliases for Git in your `.git_profile` and your `.bash_profile`
* Access old versions of your repo
* Tag
* Undo local changes (before staging, before committing, and after committing)
* Remove commits and tags
* Amend commits
* Move and add files

## Lesson: GitHub
We've already becoming Git masters, but only on our own computers. This won't work if we're working on a team! Luckily, there's GitHub. 

GitHub is a web service to host and manage git repositories. You can push up the code you've been working on for your team (or the world, in the case of open source) to see!

We've already set up Git, so we can skip to GitHub's second tutorial: [creating a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo). Follow along and get your Hello World repo up on GitHub.

Then, follow the next tutorial: [forking a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo). Follow along with the tutorial so that you have at least one branch of the Spoon-Knife repo and have submitted a pull request to the repo. 

After going through these two tutorials, you'll be able to:  

* Create a new GitHub repo
* Push to GitHub
* Fork other users' repos
* Clone repos for local use
* Manage remotes
* Pull in upstream changes
* Create branches
* Submit pull requests
